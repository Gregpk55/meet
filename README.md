# Meet App

Meet App is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) built with React and TDD. It fetches upcoming
events for a specific city using the Google Calendar API. The app combines the advantages of serverless architecture and PWAs,
offering instant loading, offline support, push notifications, and cross-platform compatibility.

<h2>Serverless Explanation</h2>

The Meet App uses Google's Calander API and AWS Lambda to provide users with a platform to show upcoming and current events in thier selected city. Using Google Calandar, users have access to Google's database of current events and information on those events. AWS Lambda is foundation of the serverless system, allowing effecient and scalable functions. Together providing a serverless application showing events and details.
